NSBridge-Example
================

A Xamarin iOS project implementing NSBridge with examples showing how to communicate bi-directionally from WebView to the Native iOS system.  Realtime Local Notification triggering, IO (system file) exploration, and even calling an ActionSheet from your web content.

This repo needs to be updated to add the updated bridge code, multiple native/hybrid components, and the multi-threaded data access (NoSQL) backend engine.
